To run the program, just import it into any IDE that accepts Python code.
For the inputs:
* The maximum amount of turns require an actual number input, otherwise it will not work.
* 
* For the coordinates, there needs to be 2 coordinates with a letter as the first character and a number as the secon character. You also need to do this twice and we recommend doing it with a comma in between. The capitalization of the letter should not affect the result. As for blank spaces, only spaces between the letter and number of each coordinate might affect the result. Only by pressing enter will the program take the input.
